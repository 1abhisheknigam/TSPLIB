Welcome to TSPLIB a library for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem! To run the program make use of the jar in the same directory as this file and use the following command:

exec −inst < filename > −alg [BnB|MSTApprox|Heur|LS1|LS2] −time < cutoff in seconds > −seed < random seed >

This library supports solving the TSP by using
- Branch and Bound
- Minimum Spanning Tree Approximation
- Heuristic: Farthest Insertion Approximation
- Local Search 1 - Iterative
- Local Search 2 - Simulated Annealing

Running via Command Line:
>A jar of the program has been provided in the base directory of the project. This jar can be used to execute the program
>To work on new files, again add them into the "src/data" folder
>The output file will be generated even if it doesn't exist
>An example of how to run the jar is provided in the "runncommands.txt" in the same directoy as this file

TO GENERATE A NEW JAR

>Export the jar in the same level as the "src" file. This will allow the jar to access the files properly

GENERAL NOTES:
>The program will make a sound when it is completed
>The original result files provided are in the "src/results/" folder
>These are further subdivided based on algorithm type, and sol or trace files respectively
